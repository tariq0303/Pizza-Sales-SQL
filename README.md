🎉 **Excited to Share My Latest SQL Project! 🍕**

I've recently completed an extensive SQL project analyzing PizzaHut sales, taking a deep dive from basic queries to advanced analytics. 🚀

- **Window Functions:** To track sales trends over time.
- **CTEs & Recursive Queries:** For complex hierarchical data handling.

✨ **Highlights:**
- Unveiled actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions.
- Improved data-driven decision-making capabilities.
- Enhanced my SQL proficiency with hands-on problem-solving.
